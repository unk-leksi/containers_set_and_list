# ðŸ“¦ Container Library in C++

*A modular container library using object-oriented programming in C++*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a collaborative academic assignment focused on implementing various data containers using object-oriented design in C++. Each student was responsible for developing one container.

**Team size**: 5 students  
**My contribution**: `Set` and singly linked `List` containers

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- âœ… Implement **one container** per student  
- âœ… Implement a **custom memory manager** derived from `MemoryManager`  
- âœ… Use the provided base classes `Container`, `AbstractSet`, and `AbstractList` (without modification)  
- âœ… Organize a class hierarchy shared within the group  
- âœ… Use the `Mem` class from `Mem.h` for memory allocation  
- âœ… Conduct **performance experiments** to evaluate memory and algorithm efficiency  

## ðŸ§© My Contributions

### âœ… Set Container
- Inherits from `AbstractSet`
- Stores unique elements only
- Supports `insert`, `remove`, and `search` operations

### âœ… Singly Linked List Container
- Inherits from `AbstractList`
- Maintains sequential element order
- Supports dynamic insertion and traversal

## ðŸš€ Implemented Features

| Feature                          | Set | List |
|----------------------------------|:---:|:----:|
| Insert elements                  | âœ…  | âœ…   |
| Remove elements                  | âœ…  | âœ…   |
| Prevent duplicates               | âœ…  | âž–   |
| Sequential traversal             | âž–  | âœ…   |
| Custom memory management         | âœ…  | âœ…   |
| Derived from abstract interfaces | âœ…  | âœ…   |

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Evaluation

- Measured runtime and memory usage for key operations
- Compared efficiency using built-in `new` vs custom `MemoryManager`
- Results provide insight into container performance and memory optimization potential
